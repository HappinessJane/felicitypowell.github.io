                            My name is Felicity, and I am an Education Futurist, Cultural Activist, and Human Potential Hacker based in Aotearoa.
                        </div>

<p>My current full-time role is Computer Science teacher at an urban low-decile school in Auckland, in my second year of the <a href="https://teachfirstnz.org/">Ako Mātātupu: Teach First NZ Programme</a>. Alongside teaching, I am a Master’s student, ultramarathoner, tech mentor, and Google Innovator. <br>More than all of this, I am a lifelong learner, which means that these titles can shift and change as needed by my community.</p>

<p>My current area of research is in educational neuroscience, studying the unlimited capacity of the human mind to innovate and identify creative solutions to complex challenges, particularly in disaster environments. I am particularly interested in the intersect of cognitive physiology, psychology, sociology, and technology, experimenting with how we can leverage machine learning to optimise workflow for teachers - so they can devote more of their time to building authentic and adaptive learning environments and relationships.</p>

                        <p><a href="http://www.peduckogy.com">I also hack teenager’s brains using Rubber Ducks.</a></p>

                        <p>I am here to find as many ways I can to learn and love, bravely and wholeheartedly, while creating more opportunities for others to do the same. If you would like to connect or collaborate with me, please get in touch. <a href=#contact>I’d love to hear from you.</a></p>

                                <p>
                                    I believe creative health and expression is an important contributor to wellbeing, and I aim to support humans around me to be inspired and fearless in their creative pursuits, no matter what their skills, talents, or resources.

                                    Being lead by questions, wonder, and awe at the world around me keeps me in a state of constant transformation and humility. I am driven by the pursuit of self-development, betterment, and growth for the benefit of all.

                                    I believe we’re here for a good time, and (perhaps) a long time. Laughter boosts the immune system, builds trust, and helps us find perspective on the challenges we all face in our humanness and humanity.

                                    Showing up for communities in a way that upholds dignity and integrity through actions as well as words. I aim to leave places, people, and projects better than I found them. Service is at the core of what I do, and is the manifestation of my hope for our future.

                            Born in New Zealand, I grew up between Aotearoa and the UK and have lived, worked, and traveled through 32 countries since, particularly Italy, Australia, the USA, France, and Scotland. My childhood exposed me directly to the difference that privilege can make in opportunity and survival, and imbued me with a strong inclination towards activism and social justice. With two technologists for parents, I also grew up learning about the exponential possibilities that technology can offer in transcending injustice and solving complex problems.

                            It took me nearly 20 years to figure out the rest, and I'm <i>still</i> figuring it out. Along the way, my life has become dedicated to learning - and learning how to learn in the most adventurous and transformative ways possible. My studies have covered Computer Science, Film, Contemplative Education, Viticulture and Oenology, Geography, Urban Development, Disaster Risk Management, Astrophysics, GIS, Writing and Poetics, Religious Studies, Musicianship, Creative Technologies, and Sociology. I have completed postgraduate research in the field of Intellectual Property Law and Indigenous Rights, investigating the ramifications of the novel Geographical Indications Act on Aotearoa's viticultural, horticultural, agricultural, and cultural ecosystems.

                            I have worked as a WSET Advanced-Certified wine industry professional, Glacier Guide, croupier, and facilitator in Te Papa’s first cultural accelerator, Mahuki. I am a certified Yoga Teacher and studied Shaolin Kung Fu at a traditional martial arts academy in Henan Province, China.

                            I have been practising Vipassana meditation since I was 18, and volunteered for the Vipassana Foundation in Italy. I have also volunteered for Amnesty International and worked as a Policy and Research Analyst on a campaign investigating workers’ rights in the Middle East. I illustrated <a href="https://vimeo.com/246210798">New Zealand’s largest comic strip</a> and have published books and booklets on self-development and positive psychology. <a href="https://www.sitdownand.com/">You can buy a recent collaboration here</a>.

                            When I'm not tinkering, teaching, or advocating for techquity, I love to climb, hike, and run around and over things. I'm here for books, wine, and single malt whisky, and I experiment with <a href="https://thegrandfranzadventure.tumblr.com/">raw photography</a> and awkward poetry. If I'm not at my desk, you can find me in the wild or in the ocean.
